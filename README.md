Casino Test

I happy happy to announce that all the tasks mentioned in the previous README file have been fixed successfully.

The application now uses the clean architecture design pattern, making it more organized and maintainable.
The loading state and fetching data feature have been fixed, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Bugs and issues have been identified and fixed, improving the stability of the application.
More information about characters has been added, enhancing the overall user experience.
The scrolling performance has been optimized, making the application more responsive.
Pagination has been implemented, allowing users to navigate through a large number of characters with ease.
Optional tasks such as infinite scrolling pagination.

The code now compiles without errors and runs seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms. We have used bloc state-management to ensure a more organized and scalable codebase. We hope you enjoy using the app and appreciate your feedback.

Thank you!
